				<p class="text">ONLINE SHOPPING launched one of the most unique
					projects in the world, titled 'Financial Assistance to
					Underprivileged Muslim Youth for Developing IT Skill' also known as
					the IsDB-BISEW IT Scholarship Project. Through this project Islamic
					Development Bank - Bangladesh Islamic Solidarity Educational Wakf
					(IsDB-BISEW) provides the assistances to Bangladeshi Muslim youths
					for the development of Information Technology (IT) skills. The aim
					is not only to develop skills of the Muslim Youths but also enable
					them to secure employment in the local as well as in the
					international market. This leads the IDB-BISEW Placement Cell to be
					organized, and the careerHub is born to serve the best in the
					placements for the IsDB-BISEW graduates.</p>
